When you're living so intensely in your head there isn't any different between what you imagine and what actually takes place. 
Therefore, you're both omnipotent and powerless.

Desire isn't lack, it's surplus energy - a claustrophobia inside your Skin

I long to be freeâ€”desperately free. Free as the stillborn are free.
My mission is to suffer for all those who suffer without knowing it. 
I must pay for them, expiate their unconsciousness, their luck to be ignorant of how unhappy they are.

We dread the future only when we are not sure we can kill ourselves when we want to.
By what aberration has suicide, the only truly normal action, become the attribute of the flawed?
I live only because it is in my power to die when I choose to: without the idea of suicide, I'd have killed myself right away.
I admire only two types of people: the potentially mad and the potential suicide.
True confessions are written with tears only. 
But my tears would drown the world, as my inner fire would reduce it to ashes.
How I wish I didn't know anything about myself and this world!
Love, a tacit agreement between two unhappy parties to overestimate each other.
We have lost, being born, as much as we shall lose, dying. Everything.
To think we could have spared ourselves from living all that we have lived!
